# Countdown Timer

This is a simple countdown timer application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to set a specific date and time, and the timer will count down to that point. The application also includes pause and reset buttons for added control over the timer.

## Features

- Set a future date and time for the countdown
- Display the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds
- Pause the countdown timer
- Reset the countdown timer

## Usage

1. Open (coming soon) or HTML file in your browser.
2. Enter the target date in the "Date" input field (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
3. Enter the target time in the "Time" input field (format: HH:MM).
4. Click the "Start" button to begin the countdown.
5. Use the "Pause" button to temporarily stop the countdown.
6. Use the "Reset" button to reset the countdown timer to its initial state.

## Code Structure

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main JavaScript code is located in the `script.js` file.

### Key Functions

1. `start()`: This function is responsible for initializing the countdown timer. It retrieves the target date and time from the input fields, calculates the end time, and starts the countdown interval.

2. `startTime(endTime)`: This function is called at regular intervals (every second) to update the countdown timer display. It calculates the remaining time based on the current time and the target end time, and updates the respective HTML elements to display the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

3. `pause()`: This function stops the countdown interval by calling `clearInterval(intervalId)`.

4. `reset()`: This function resets the countdown timer by stopping the interval, clearing the interval ID, and setting the display values to 0.

### Dependencies

The application does not rely on any external libraries or resources.
